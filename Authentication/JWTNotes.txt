protected routes
Node & Express web API: JWT means- JSON Web Token
form or user identification after the initial user authentication takes place
when user completes their authentication, REST API will issue client application an access token & a refresh token
access token = short time before it expires (5 to 15 minutes)
refresh token = longer duration before it expires (several hours, a day, or even days)

Hazards
XSS: Cross-site scripting
CSRF: Cross-site request forgery

API sends & receives access tokens as JSON data
to avoid the previous risks
front end client applications recommended to only store access tokens in memory, so the memory will be automatically lost when the app is closed
should not be stored in localStorage or a cookie
if you can store it somewhere with JavaScript, a hacker can also retrieve it with JavaScript
keep access tokens in memory/ current application state

API will issue refresh tokens as HTTPOnly cookie
Not accessible with JavaScript
must have expiry at some point - requires user to log in again
refresh tokens should not have the ability to issue new refresh tokens - grants indefinite access if it falls into the wrong hands

ACCESS TOKEN:
Issued at user Authorization
users application uses for RESTAPIs protected routes access until it expires
verified with middleware after each request
New token issued at refresh request to REST API refresh API endpoint
