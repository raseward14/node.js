middleware is anything btw req and res to .next() is really middleware (route handler)

3 TYPES: 
1. built in middleware
--app.use()
--just like http methods (.get() .put() .post() .delete()), works as a waterfall
--built in middleware does not need the next() called, its already built in
2. custom middleware (we create ourselves)
--custom logger
3. middleware from 3rd parties
