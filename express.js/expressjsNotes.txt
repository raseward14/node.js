fast, unopinionated, minimalist web FRAMEWORK for Node.js

npm i express -> install express

express handles regular expressions
automatically sets correct status code (200, 404) and content type (.css, .png, text/html, application/json)

cannot GET /index -> expresses default 404 does not exist

express handles routes like a waterfall, at the end you can put your default, catch all
EXPRESS WILL READ FROM TOP DOWN, IF YOU PUT ANYTHING BELOW YOUR CATCH ALL * IT WILL NOT BE READ

route handlers are very similar to middleware
